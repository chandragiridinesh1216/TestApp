Arbitration is final and binding and subject to only very limited review by a court. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.</strong>

            <em>Binding Arbitration </em>

            <sup>&reg;</sup>, the Connected Vehicle Services, or these Terms (including the validity and scope of the agreement to arbitrate) and your relationship with us.

            <em>Arbitration Procedures </em>
        </p>
        <p>If the parties are unable to resolve any dispute or claim through informal means, either party may initiate binding arbitration of such dispute or claim by sending notice demanding arbitration to the other party. Any demand for arbitration must be made within the shorter of the applicable statute of limitations or one year after the cause of action has accrued. The arbitration of any dispute or claim shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;
            <strong>AAA</strong>&rdquo;) and shall be conducted before a single arbitrator pursuant to the applicable rules established by the AAA. The AAA rules and information about arbitration and fees are available online at www.adr.org. If the AAA shall be unavailable or decline to administer the arbitration, and the parties do not agree on a substitute, you and we agree that a substitute administrator or arbitrator shall be appointed by the court. You and we agree that these Terms evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and this arbitration provision will be interpreted and enforced in accordance with the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law, and not governed by state law. Any arbitration shall be held in Los Angeles County, California, unless the AAA or the arbitrator shall determine that venue in such city is unreasonably burdensome, in which case the AAA or the arbitrator shall select a venue that is not unreasonably burdensome to both you and us. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language. An arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available in a court, including injunctive or declaratory relief to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim, and must follow and enforce these Terms as a court would. Any arbitration shall be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award. Judgment on any arbitration award may be entered in any court having proper jurisdiction.

        <p>Arbitration fees shall be determined in accordance with the arbitration rules. Each party will bear the fees and expenses of its own attorneys, experts, witnesses and preparation and presentation of evidence at the arbitration. However, a party may recover any or all fees and expenses from another party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines. Except for claims determined to be frivolous, we agree not to seek an award of attorneys&rsquo; fees in arbitration even if an award is otherwise available under applicable law.</p>
        <p>
            <em>Class Action Waiver and Jury Waiver </em>
        </p>
        <p>You and we each agree that any proceeding, whether in arbitration or in court, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not on a class, mass, representative, or private attorney general basis. You and we further agree that no claims of other parties may be consolidated with your or our claims in the arbitration without both your and our consent. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, you and we each waive any right to a jury trial.</p>
        <p>If any part of this arbitration provision is later deemed invalid as a matter of law, then it shall be severed and the remaining portions of this provision shall remain in effect, with the exception that if a court or arbitrator determines in an action between you and us that the above class action waiver is unenforceable, then this arbitration provision will be void as to you.</p>

            <strong>Please read this arbitration provision carefully. It affects rights that you may otherwise have. It provides for resolution of most disputes through arbitration instead of court trials and class actions. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court, uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and discovery is more limited. Arbitration is final and binding and subject to only very limited review by a court. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Binding Arbitration</strong>
        </p>
        <p>This arbitration provision is intended to be interpreted broadly to encompass all disputes or claims arising out of or relating to the Application or this Agreement (including the validity or invalidity and scope of the agreement to arbitrate) and your relationship with us. We will attempt to resolve any disputes or claims to your satisfaction and ours. If, however, a matter arises that cannot be resolved promptly between you and us, you agree that any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to the Application or this Agreement and your relationship with Honda or any affiliate, including their respective employees, agents, contractors or service providers, (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory) shall be resolved by binding arbitration, except that either of us may take claims to small claims court if they qualify for hearing by such a court. The obligation to arbitrate under this provision shall extend to any claims by you against any affiliate, officer, director, agent, employee, or contractor of Honda. This arbitration provision shall not apply to claims of patent, trademark, or copyright infringement or misappropriation of trade secrets.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Arbitration Procedures</strong>
        </p>
        <p>If the parties are unable to resolve any dispute or claim through informal means, either party may initiate binding arbitration of such dispute or claim by sending notice demanding arbitration to the other party. Any demand for arbitration must be made within the shorter of the applicable statute of limitations or one year after the cause of action has accrued. The arbitration of any dispute or claim shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;
            <strong>AAA</strong>&rdquo;) and shall be conducted before a single arbitrator pursuant to the applicable rules established by the AAA. The AAA rules and information about arbitration and fees are available online at
            <u>www.adr.org</u>. If the AAA shall be unavailable or decline to administer the arbitration, and the parties do not agree on a substitute, you and we agree that a substitute administrator or arbitrator shall be appointed by the court. You and we agree that this Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and this arbitration provision will be interpreted and enforced in accordance with the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act. Any arbitration shall be held in Los Angeles County, California, unless the AAA or the arbitrator shall determine that venue in such city is unreasonably burdensome, in which case the AAA or the arbitrator shall select a venue that is not unreasonably burdensome to both you and us. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language. An arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available in a court, including injunctive or declaratory relief to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim, and must follow and enforce this Agreement as a court would, except that the arbitrator shall have no authority to award punitive, exemplary or multiple damages. Any arbitration shall be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award. Judgment on any arbitration award may be entered in any court having proper jurisdiction.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Costs of Arbitration </strong>
        </p>
        <p>Arbitration fees shall be determined in accordance with the arbitration rules. Each party will bear the fees and expenses of its own attorneys, experts, witnesses and preparation and presentation of evidence at the arbitration. However, a party may recover any or all fees and expenses from another party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines. Except for claims determined to be frivolous, we agree not to seek an award of attorneys&rsquo; fees in arbitration even if such an award is otherwise available under applicable law.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Class Action Waiver and Jury Waiver</strong>
        </p>
        <p>You and we each agree that any proceeding, whether in arbitration or in court, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not on a class, mass, representative, or private attorney general basis. You and we further agree that no claims of other parties may be consolidated with your or our claims in the arbitration without both your and our consent. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, you and we each waive any right to a jury trial.</p>
        <p>If any part of this arbitration provision is later deemed invalid as a matter of law, then it shall be severed and the remaining portions of this provision shall remain in effect, with the exception that if a court or arbitrator determines in an action between you and us that the above class action waiver is unenforceable, then this arbitration provision will be void as to you.</p>

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be void, invalid, unenforceable or illegal, it shall be severed to the minimum extent required for the other provisions to continue in full force and effect, except as otherwise provided herein.
